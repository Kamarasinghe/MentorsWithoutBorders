    - Passed all mentors as array
    - Returns array of mentors that specialize in 
      topics the current user is interested in
  }

    - Takes in number to restrict age gap, defaults to 5
    
    - Filter array for mentors within same age as current user
    - If resulting array's length is less than 10
      - Invoke function again but add 5 to current restrict num
    
    - Return filtered array
  }

  Mentors active around same time {
    - Takes in array passed from above function
    
    - Filter array for mentors that are active same time as user
    - If resulting array is less than 10
